<p><a href="https://github.com/asafonov/monly">Monly</a> is an awesome budget planner. It supports transactions logging, budgets, reports, synchronization across your devices and a lot of other features. Monly is distributed so every device has itâ€™s own copy of data. You may loose a device, but not your data</p>
