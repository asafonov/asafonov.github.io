<p>Hi! My name is Alexander Safonov and I am a programmer currently living on Earth, Solar System, Local Interstellar Cloud, Local Bubble, Orion–Cygnus Arm, Milky Way. I like programming (not to be confused with software engineering) a lot, so at my spare time I create awesome software. The full list you can find in “Projects” section of this site.</p>
<p>In my CS related life I am interested in web development (Javascript, PHP, Python, Rich Internet Applications), mobile devices programming, information security and computer-geek culture ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>But not by computer alone. I also like:</p>
<ul class="text_ul">
  <li>Music. I can play guitar, bass, drums. I also like idea of making music with computer.</li>
  <li>Reading (science fiction mostly)</li>
  <li>Trips and visiting new places</li>
  <li>Coffee. Black, just like my metal</li>
  <li>Good companies with interesting talks</li>
  <li>A lot of other stuff, actually</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to contact me I can be reached via email: <a href="mailto:me@asafonov.org">me@asafonov.org</a> (<a href="data/asafonov.asc">PGP</a>). I hate talking on the phone</p>
<p>I don't use social networks a lot but you may find me on <a href="https://github.com/asafonov">github</a>.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
